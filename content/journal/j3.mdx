I'll keep the list of books i read. 

I read mostly literary fiction from Turkish and world literature — with a soft spot for **magical realism**. This past summer I kept circling back to **Gabriel García Márquez** and fell for that feeling where reality tilts just a few degrees and suddenly everything glows. Lately I’m also sneaking in philosophy (just started a book by, **Seneca**) and the occasional tech/ML book to keep my brain caffeinated.



## Currently reading
- **Why Machines Learn** — *Anil Ananthaswamy*  2024
You can find out about this book on research section. 
- **Şıpsevdi** — *Hüseyin Rahmi Gürpınar*  
  A gleefully satirical peek at turn-of-the-century Istanbul; absurd social poses, silliness with bite. It’s witty, a little chaotic, and very alive.

## Recent favorites
- **One Hundred Years of Solitude** — *Gabriel García Márquez*  
- Like poems by *Jorge Luis Borges*  

## Comfort + study pile
- **Mathematics for Computer Science** — *Eric Lehman & Tom Leighton*  
  My “stretch and breathe” book; I dip in to refresh discrete math muscles.
- Rotating tech shelf: papers, notes, and whatever helps me connect theory to the small tools I’m building.
