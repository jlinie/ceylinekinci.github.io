I'll keep the list of books i read. 

I read mostly literary fiction from Turkish and world literature — with a soft spot for **magical realism**. This past summer I kept circling back to **Gabriel García Márquez** and fell for that feeling where reality tilts just a few degrees and suddenly everything glows. Lately I’m also sneaking in philosophy (just started a book by, **Seneca**) and the occasional tech/ML book to keep my brain caffeinated.



## Currently reading
- **Why Machines Learn** — *Anil Ananthaswamy*  2024
I recommend this book to people that wants to learn about artificial intelligence from scratch. It starts the story by the creation of first perceptron model by Rosenblatt, a pyscologist. And goes through math underlying the artificial intelligence up until today.
The book even tells about Donald Hebb's idea that put as 'Neurons that fire together wire together.' which is the way of summarizing the connections between neurons that strengthen when one neuron's output is consistently involved in the firing of another, and they weaken otherwise. 
I will add more detail about this book while reading. And if you are interested in reading similar, I'll be happy to reach suggestions.  
- **Şıpsevdi** — *Hüseyin Rahmi Gürpınar*  
  A gleefully satirical peek at turn-of-the-century Istanbul; absurd social poses, silliness with bite. It’s witty, a little chaotic, and very alive.

## Recent favorites
- **One Hundred Years of Solitude** — *Gabriel García Márquez*  
- Like poems by *Jorge Luis Borges*  

## Comfort + study pile
- **Mathematics for Computer Science** — *Eric Lehman & Tom Leighton*  
  My “stretch and breathe” book; I dip in to refresh discrete math muscles.
- Rotating tech shelf: papers, notes, and whatever helps me connect theory to the small tools I’m building.
