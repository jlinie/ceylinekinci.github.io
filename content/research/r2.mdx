I recommend this book to people that wants to learn about artificial intelligence from scratch. It starts the story by the creation of first perceptron model by Rosenblatt, a pyscologist. And goes through math underlying the artificial intelligence up until today. 
The book even tells about Donald Hebb's idea that put as 'Neurons that fire together wire together.' which is the way of summarizing the connections between neurons that strengthen when one neuron's output is consistently involved in the firing of another, and they weaken otherwise. 
I will add more detail about this book while reading. And if you are interested in reading similar, I'll be happy to reach suggestions.
